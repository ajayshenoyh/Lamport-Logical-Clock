# Lamport-Logical-Clock
Lamport Logical Clock algorithm implementation in C++. The first algorithm is the calculation of Lamport Clocks for all the events in the processor and the Second algorithm is verification of Lamport algorithm. We have successfully implemented the first part of the algorithm, and we were not able to solve the receive event verification on the second part.
